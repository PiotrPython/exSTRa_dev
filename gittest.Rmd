##Vignette exSTRa - extending the search.

Along with the standard search for the known loci that are in [insert file name] it is possible to extend the search to other loci. With exSTRa this is very easy to do changing file [insert file name] to [new file name] extends the search to all the loci in [new file name]. 

[Additional script] is a useful script that formats output from other functions which filter down to interesting candidate loci. For example [insert file name 2] was produced by filtering down to loci [confirm with make this makes sense] that appear to have a function in human brain tissue.

Excel is really fun [false excel is stupid](./inst/exdatarepeat_expansion_disorders.txt)
